# Cloud Migration Automation Using LLM Agentic Framework

This repository contains the development of an AI-driven LLM agentic framework for automating the migration of AI/ML workloads across cloud environments. The framework leverages **Terraform** and **LLM agents** to replicate existing infrastructure and automate cloud resource provisioning in a target cloud environment.

## Overview

This framework automates the migration of AI/ML workloads across cloud platforms using Terraform and **Large Language Model (LLM) agents**. The key components include:

- **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automates the provisioning of cloud resources in the target environment.
- **LLM Agents:** Used to analyze existing infrastructure and generate Terraform configurations to replicate it on a different cloud platform.

### Current Progress

- Completed the basic setup of the Terraform configurations for cloud migration.
- Established the foundation for the LLM agentic framework to understand and replicate infrastructure.
- Successful execution of initial migrations using Terraform between cloud platforms.

## Features

- **Cloud Migration Automation:** Automatically generate and execute Terraform code to migrate AI/ML workloads across cloud environments (e.g., GCP â†’ AWS).
- **Infrastructure Replication:** Replicates existing cloud infrastructure by analyzing resource configurations and creating corresponding setups in a target environment.
- **Cross-Cloud Compatibility:** Supports migration to multiple cloud providers (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) by adapting Terraform scripts dynamically.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to add more cloud providers or other use cases (e.g., automated test case generation).

## Getting Started

To get started with the framework, clone this repository and follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Terraform** installed on your system.
- A **GCP account** for cloud resources.
- **Python 3.x** for LLM agent integration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicckykr/gcp_terraform.git
cd gcp_terraform
